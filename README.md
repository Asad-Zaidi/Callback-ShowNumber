#A function named *showNumber* is defined  
This function takes two parameters: *number* and *callback*.
It then calls the *callback* function, passing the *number* as an argument. 
The purpose of this function is to execute a *callback* function with a given *number*.

The number *123* is passed and an anonymous callback function as arguments to *showNumber*. 
The anonymous callback function takes a parameter named result and logs a message to the console,
including the value of result. So, in this case, it will log "The number is: *123*" to the console.

Finally, the *showNumber* function is exported using *module.exports*. This makes the *showNumber* function available for use in other files.
